Structured-Only Price Prediction Summary (Baseline)
---------------------------------------------------

This file documents the methodology and results for our structured-only baseline model
in the ValueVision project. This experiment serves as the foundational benchmark 
before introducing textual and visual modalities.

Data Source:
- Melbourne housing transaction dataset (2013–2015)
- Filtered top 1% price outliers and missing values
- One-hot encoded categorical property types

Features Used:
- Numeric property attributes (e.g., bedroom, bathroom, parking)
- Derived features: bed-to-bath ratio, age at sale
- Final feature count: 3 (after RFECV feature selection)

Modeling Approach:
- StandardScaler applied to numeric features
- 80/20 random train/test split (random_state=42)
- Models trained:
  • XGBoost Regressor
  • Random Forest Regressor
  • Gradient Boosting Regressor
- Hyperparameters inspired by MHPP paper

Results (MAE / RMSE):
---------------------------------------------------
XGBoost:         $205870 / $294527
Random Forest:   $203867 / $292549
Gradient Boosting: $204131 / $293032

Diagnostics:
- Diagnostic plots for each model saved as: *_diagnostics.png
- SHAP feature importance saved as: shap_feature_importance.png

Next Steps:
- Compare with text-only and image-enhanced models
- Conduct ablation on feature combinations
- Document final multimodal fusion results
